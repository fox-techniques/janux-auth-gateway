# üì• Installation

## üì¶ pip 

**JANUX Authentication Gateway** is published as a python package and can be installed with
`pip`, ideally by using a [virtual environment]. Open up a terminal and install with:

=== "Latest"

    ``` sh
    pip install janux-auth-gateway
    ```

=== "1.x"

    ``` sh
    pip install janux-auth-gateway=="1.*" # (1)!
    ```

    1.  **JANUX** uses [semantic versioning].

        This will make sure that you don't accidentally [upgrade to the next
        major version], which may include breaking changes that silently corrupt
        your site. Additionally, you can use `pip freeze` to create a lockfile,
        so builds are reproducible at all times:

        ```
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        ```

        Now, the lockfile can be used for installation:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies:
[fastapi], [uvicorn], [pymongo], [motor] and [requests]. **JANUX** always strives to support the latest versions, so there's no need to
install those packages separately.

## üé≠ Poetry 

**JANUX** recommends using Poetry for its outstanding dependency management, use:

```bash
poetry add janux-auth-gateway
```

This command downloads and installs the package and its dependencies and adds the package as a dependency in your `pyproject.toml`.

After installation, you can start using the package in your project. If you need to enter the virtual environment managed by Poetry, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

Verify the Installation:

```bash
poetry show janux-auth-gateway
```

Updating the Package:

```bash
poetry update janux-auth-gateway
```

## üêô GitHub

**JANUX** can be directly used from [GitHub] by cloning the
repository into a subfolder of your project root which might be useful if you
want to use the very latest version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fox-techniques/janux-auth-gateway.git
cd janux-auth-gateway
pip install -e .
```

## üê≥ Docker

If you prefer containerized deployment, use the official Docker image:

```bash
docker pull fox-techniques/janux-auth-gateway
```

To run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name janux-auth-gateway fox-techniques/janux-auth-gateway
```


## üö¢ Docker Compose

For multi-container setups including **MongoDB** and **Redis**, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

To stop services:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
